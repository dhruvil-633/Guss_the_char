# 🎮 GUESS THE CHARACTER – AI Game  
*A machine learning–powered Akinator for Marvel & DC heroes*  




## 🧠 Overview  

**Guess the Character** is an interactive AI guessing game that tries to identify which **superhero or character** you’re thinking of — from **64 Marvel & DC heroes** — by asking a short series of yes/no questions.  

The project uses **Decision Tree models** trained on a structured dataset of hero traits (powers, gadgets, origins, etc.) to make logical guesses — just like **Akinator**, but custom-built and open-source.

---

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ Machine learning–based hero prediction  
✅ 7-question & 14-question model modes  
✅ Trait importance calculated via **Information Gain**  
✅ Trained with scikit-learn Decision Trees  
✅ Optional **Flask web interface**  
✅ Expandable dataset (add more heroes easily)

## 🧩 Dataset Features  

Each hero is represented by 20+ binary or categorical attributes, e.g.:  

- `superhero`, `uses_gadgets`, `flies`, `super_strength`  
- `team_member`, `detective`, `leader`, `scientist`, `immortal`  
- `genre_Marvel`, `genre_DC`, `alien_origin`, `tech_genius`  

### 🔝 Top Informative Features (Information Gain)
| Rank | Feature | IG |
|------|----------|----|
| 1 | uses_gadgets | 0.9993 |
| 2 | team_member | 0.9993 |
| 3 | enhanced_senses | 0.9985 |
| 4 | super_strength | 0.9973 |
| 5 | super_agility | 0.9973 |

## 🧮 How It Works  

1. The game starts by asking a set of yes/no questions.  
2. Each question corresponds to one feature from the dataset.  
3. The trained **Decision Tree model** uses your responses to narrow down possibilities.  
4. After 7 or 14 questions, it predicts which hero you’re thinking of.
